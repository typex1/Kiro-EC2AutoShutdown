# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an AWS Lambda function that automatically shuts down EC2 instances based on a specific tag. The function will identify EC2 instances tagged with `AutoShutdown=yes` and stop them, providing a cost-effective way to manage development and testing environments that don't need to run continuously.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a cloud administrator, I want to automatically shutdown tagged EC2 instances, so that I can reduce AWS costs by stopping non-production instances when they're not needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Lambda function is invoked THEN the system SHALL scan all EC2 instances in the current AWS region
2. WHEN an EC2 instance has the tag `AutoShutdown=yes` THEN the system SHALL stop that instance
3. WHEN an EC2 instance is already stopped THEN the system SHALL skip that instance without error
4. WHEN the shutdown process completes THEN the system SHALL log the number of instances processed and stopped

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a cloud administrator, I want detailed logging of shutdown operations, so that I can track which instances were affected and troubleshoot any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Lambda function starts THEN the system SHALL log the start of the shutdown process
2. WHEN an instance is identified for shutdown THEN the system SHALL log the instance ID and current state
3. WHEN an instance shutdown succeeds THEN the system SHALL log the successful shutdown with instance ID
4. WHEN an instance shutdown fails THEN the system SHALL log the error with instance ID and error details
5. WHEN the process completes THEN the system SHALL log a summary of total instances processed and stopped

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a cloud administrator, I want the Lambda function to handle AWS API errors gracefully, so that temporary issues don't cause the entire shutdown process to fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AWS API calls fail due to throttling THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
2. WHEN AWS API calls fail due to permissions THEN the system SHALL log the permission error and continue with other instances
3. WHEN AWS API calls fail due to network issues THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times before logging the failure
4. WHEN an individual instance shutdown fails THEN the system SHALL continue processing remaining instances

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a cloud administrator, I want the Lambda function to be configurable, so that I can adjust the tag key/value and target specific regions without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Lambda function is deployed THEN the system SHALL read the shutdown tag key from environment variables with default `AutoShutdown`
2. WHEN the Lambda function is deployed THEN the system SHALL read the shutdown tag value from environment variables with default `yes`
3. WHEN environment variables are not set THEN the system SHALL use the default values
4. WHEN the Lambda function runs THEN the system SHALL only process instances in the current AWS region

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a cloud administrator, I want appropriate IAM permissions defined, so that the Lambda function can perform its operations securely with minimal required privileges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Lambda function is deployed THEN the system SHALL have permission to describe EC2 instances
2. WHEN the Lambda function is deployed THEN the system SHALL have permission to stop EC2 instances
3. WHEN the Lambda function is deployed THEN the system SHALL have permission to write CloudWatch logs
4. WHEN the Lambda function is deployed THEN the system SHALL NOT have permissions beyond what's required for its operation
